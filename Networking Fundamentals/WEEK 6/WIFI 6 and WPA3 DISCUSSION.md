## WIFI 6 & WPA3 DISCUSSION

In this discussion, we are focusing on WiFi 6 and WPA3.  No doubt, wireless networking technologies enable businesses to provide networked services to a wide range of users and devices.  This ultimately increases capabilities in regards to business functionality and workflow.  As new devices are added to the wireless network daily, the demand increases on the infrastructure providing wireless services.  In parallel, security issues increase based on the number and many different devices connecting to the same infrastructure.

In your response:

Highlight the improvements both WiFi 6 and WPA3 bring to wireless infrastructures compared to their predecessors, WiFi 5 and WPA2.  

  - WiFi 6 is faster generation of WiFi that uses old framework of 802.11ac. This new build offers connectivity improvements for WiFi 6 enabled devices while maintaining backwards compatibility for older devices. It works better in higher-density environments, supports an increased capacity of devices, improves the battery life of compatible devices, and boasts higher data transfer rates than its predecessors.

  >"Wi-Fi 6 is capable of a maximum throughput of 9.6 Gbps across multiple channels, compared to 3.5 Gbps on Wi-Fi 5. In theory, a WiFi 6 capable router could hit speeds over 250% faster than current WiFi 5 devices."

  - WiFi 6's higher speed capability is thanks to technology such as orthogonal frequency division multiple access and beamforming, which enables higher data rates at a given range to increase network capacity. Also 1024 quadrature amplitude modulation, which increases the throughput for emerging, bandwidth intensive uses by encoding more data in the same amount of spectrum.

  - WPA3 has two versions that differ in features but all live under the WPA3 title. WPA3-Personal, which provides more individualized encryption, and WPA3-Enterprise, which boosts cryptographic strength for networks transmitting sensitive data. Along with these two deployment modes, WPA3 also unveiled Wi-Fi Easy Connect, a feature thatâ€™s supposed to simplify the process of pairing Wi-Fi devices without displays, such as IoT devices; and Wi-Fi Enhanced Open, an optional feature that allows for seamless encryption on open Wi-Fi hotspot networks. So overall the main differences WPA3-Personal uses 128-bit encryption key. WPA3-Enterprise uses 192-bit encryption key. WPA3 replaces the traditional PSK with simultaneous authentication that was used in WPA2.
