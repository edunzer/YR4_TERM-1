Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Subnetting
Instructions:  Using CIDR subnetting, create an IP address scheme using the following scenario.  You will need to create a subnet for each department.  Your subnet must be large enough to include all department users into one subnet.  Hint: you'll need to reference the subnet mask chart, shown in the lecture slides, to determine the proper subnet.

Department	# of Hosts
Sales	4084
Marketing	518
Finance	243
Logistics	112
Administration	67
IT Department	25
Router-to-Router A	2
Router-to-Router B	2
Router-to-Router C	2
Your beginning network ID is: 172.18.0.0/16

For each subnet, you will need to show:

Department name
  -
Network ID
  -
Host IP Range
  -
Broadcast IP
  -


Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)
Instructions:  Like the last scenario, you will create a subnet for each department.  This time, you are going to use VLSM to find the right-sized subnet for each department.  When creating your network ID, make sure you include CIDR notation.  Hint: you will need to utilize the subnet mask table from the lecture slides to find the correct sized subnet.

Department	# of Hosts
Sales	4095
Marketing	509
Finance	220
Logistics	99
Administration	95
IT Department	24
Printers	10
Router-to-Router A	2
Router-to-Router B	2
Your beginning network ID is: 172.27.0.0/16

For each subnet, you will need to show:

Department name
  -
Network ID
  -
Host IP Range
  -
Broadcast IP
  -
