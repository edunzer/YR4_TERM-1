## DNS SECURITY

As we learn about Domain Name Service (DNS) and the benefits it provides to our networks; we also need to pay attention to potential drawbacks.  Specifically, we need to focus on DNS security and what is required to protect our DNS servers.

In this weekâ€™s discussion, perform some research on the Internet in regards to DNS security vulnerabilities.  Find two commonly exploited DNS vulnerabilities and discuss the impact on the network and its users.  Then, discuss how these vulnerabilities are being mitigated or controlled.  In other words, what are organizations doing to protect DNS servers and the services they provide?

One potential area to focus on is DNS Security Extensions or DNSSEC.
