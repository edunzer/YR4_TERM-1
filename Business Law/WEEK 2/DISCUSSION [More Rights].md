## DISCUSSION MORE RIGHTS

What are some other rights do you have that surprised you? Are there limitations?
  - None of the rights that US citizens surprised me, the thing that does surprise me is that there are still so few and in such short sentences that can be construed into different meanings. Many of the amendments listed not only can be seen from different angles but also have been used in such way to get around rules that were put in place.
  - There should be no limitations as far as "federal" rights go. The states can not overturn the rights that a citizen has and they can not change what those rights mean.

Summarize freedom of religion.  How might that come up in a business setting?
  - That the US does not have any state endorsed religion and that they can not favor any religion, and that you can not be prohibited from being part of a certain religion. The biggest part of this is that practice and belief. These are two entirely different parts of the freedom of religion right. belief is protected under your rights as a citizen and you can belief what ever you want, but practice is often limited in certain situations. This is due to the fact that often times religious practice can infringe on other rights and rules that are put in place.
  - Now this same kind of thinking applies to businesses where citizens are of course allowed to have there own religious beliefs but practice is not allowed.  

How about privacy in an employment setting?  Do we have privacy rights while working?
  - As far as employment rights go it seems to be largely related to state held constitutions and what they allow. This means that most businesses have complete control over there employees privacy.

  - (Not sure what privacy we are really talking about though. If its simple things like desks and devices the simple answer should be that its the businesses property and they can do what they want.)

  - Although the states have most of the control there are some limits to the business that do not come from the state. employees have the right to keep private facts confidential, along with having the right to personal space. If an employer discloses private facts or lies about an employee they can be held accountable.
