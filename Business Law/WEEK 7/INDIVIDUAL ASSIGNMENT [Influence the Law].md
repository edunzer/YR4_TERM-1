## INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT | INFLUENCE THE LAW

This is your opportunity to influence a pending bill.  You will research a pending bill, identify your representative, and then write a professionally worded letter expressing your reasons why the bill should pass or not pass.  The key to this assignment is to understand the bill and then form a significant rationale to support your side.  Your letter needs to be professionally written.  Don’t be surprised if you get a response from your representative!  

Step 1:  Find a Local, State or Federal bill that is currently before the legislative body.  Find a BILL that particularly interests you.  Review the bill and understand the issues at hand.  Here are a few helpful links:

Tracking the Gov:  https://www.govtrack.us (Links to an external site.)

Oregon State Legislature:  https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/ (Links to an external site.)

United States House of Representatives:  http://www.house.gov/ (Links to an external site.)

United States Senate:  http://www.senate.gov/ (Links to an external site.)

Klamath County Board of Commissioners:  http://klamathcounty.org/commissioners/ (Links to an external site.)

Step 2:  Find your representative who will be voting on this issue.  Depending on the bill you select, this could be a local, state or federal representative.

Step 3: Write your letter.  Your letter should be properly formatted with perfect grammar, spelling, etc.  Here is a link to how to format a letter- http://www.writing.engr.psu.edu/workbooks/letter_format.html (Links to an external site.).  (I’m happy to review drafts before you send).  The letter should have at least three paragraphs.  The first should be an introduction about why you are writing, a bit about yourself and your interest in the bill (don’t say you are doing this for a school assignment!!).  The second paragraph should provide supporting reasons that back up your opinion on the issue.  It is important that this is not just fluff.  Rather this is your opportunity to influence and argue your point.  So make it good!  Lastly, the final paragraph should conclude your thoughts, state your willingness to answer any questions, and thank the representative. Upload your letter.  

Step 4:  Once you receive instructor feedback on the construction of your letter, you are encouraged to send the letter (with edits) to your representative!  You can send it via e-mail or snail mail.  Your representative often will respond to you regarding your letter.

Ron Wyden
Senator for Oregon

Senator Wyden,

I am writing to express my support for S. 1741, Reducing the Cost of Energy Storage Act, as it will help address the very serious problem of household green energy and the lack of support that lies in most households.

After reading many articles and papers about our current standing in the green energy revolution it is imperative that storage become a bigger factor then just simple creation. This factor alone has halted the very promising idea of solar on households to reduce the creation of energy from large power plants.

And Although I do find it necessary to solve this energy storage problem to reduce waste and create a better all-around system I do think it is important to not spend considerable amounts of time on perfecting the solution to a problem. By this I mean the more and more time it takes to get a "perfect system" up and running the longer time we will have where no green solution is running at its full capacity.

As you may know many people have the mindset that technology will magically catch up to our time and save us all. Giving them the impression that green energy solutions are not important today. This thinking has hindered the idea that we could be pouring money into green solutions like solar, that is arguably not the "best" solution out there but can limit the effects of non-green energy in the meantime.

Therefore I urge you to pass this bill and many others that improve the development of green energy but also to remember that more time and effort needs to be put into right now solutions that might not fix the problem buy will help slow the negative effects of non-green energy.

Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this use further.

Sincerely,
Ethan Dunzer
