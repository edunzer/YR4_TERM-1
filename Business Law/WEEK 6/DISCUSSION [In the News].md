Dismissal of manufacturer’s product liability claim vs. supplier reversed

- Plaintiff AcBel Polytech, who produces power supplies for EMC Corp. to use in its data storage devices, claimed that thousands of re-designed microcircuits it purchased from its own supplier, defendant Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., to serve as voltage regulators for the units, were defectively designed, causing EMC’s devices to falter and resulting in economic harm to the plaintiff.

 - However the microcircuits did not malfunction when subjected to industry-standard testing, and Fairchild’s expert testified at a bench trial that the failure could only be duplicated by creating extreme conditions.

 - After trial, a U.S. District Court judge dismissed AcBel’s claim, holding that the plaintiff failed to show that Fairchild could have discovered that the product was either dangerous or defective through reasonable testing. But the 1st Circuit reversed this; saying that "reasonableness of testing is inconsequential in a breach of implied warranty case that alleges harm only to the product itself". There main reasoning being "By considering foreseeability by reasonable testing for its analysis of the … implied warranty of merchantability test, the district court improperly commingled contract-based and tort-based theories of implied warranty". This lead to the eventual deciding factor that "When economic loss is the only injury that is claimed, recovery for breach of an implied warranty should be construed as contract-based, not tort-based, under Massachusetts law."
