## DISCUSSION | UCC

What is the UCC?  What is covered under the UCC?
  - The UCC is a model law in the US which covers the sales of goods among the states which have adopted it, which is all of them. The main issues that are coved under the UCC are issues dealing with the types of commercial contracts, mostly related to the sale or leasing of goods and the details that entail those transactions.  

What is a merchant under the UCC?
  - A merchant according to the UCC is a person that deals with the goods that are exchanged in a UCC sale. This is often someone that has the occupation of selling said goods to customers through a transactions.

What does the UCC allow for "Flexibility?"
  - The Flexibility in reference has to deal with the transaction of items to merchants. Often merchants purchase or sell lots of small value items that have no real reason to have an official UCC contract for purchase. This is called a common law transaction where the person selling the item to the merchant or buying from the merchant does not have an official bill of sale contract making it less of a hassle to purchase said items.

Consider this scenario:  At the beginning of a worldwide pandemic, toilet paper is flying off the shelves as  Americans are stocking up.  A store owner contacts her supplier to place an order for Charmin, her best selling TP.  The supplier, who is trying to serve all his stores, is out of Charmin.

  - Can the supplier ship another brand as a replacement to the store owner?
    - No they cant unless there is an agreement in place that the store owner wants another brand or has specified that if there first choice, "Charmin", is no longer available then they would like another brand.

  - What options does the store owner have when receiving the alternate TP brand?
    - Considering that there was no request for the alternate TP and no transaction the store owner is not liable for the suppling companies shipment. If they do however sell that product then they could be considered liable for the payment of that shipment.

  - What is the advantage of flexible terms under the UCC to this store owner vs. definite terms under normal contract rules?  
    - The main advantage of normal contract rules is that the store own goes by the simple exchange rules that complete a transaction. This is where both parties agree to an exchange of items, whether that be money for product or product for product, when they are exchanged a transaction has taken place and that's it. With UCC contract agreements are often simpler and don't need the constant exchange transaction agreement in order to get your goods. Meaning that if you wanted a constant flow of goods for a yr delivered to your door then UCC contracts make more sense because you don't have to agree to that delivery every time like you would with common law.
