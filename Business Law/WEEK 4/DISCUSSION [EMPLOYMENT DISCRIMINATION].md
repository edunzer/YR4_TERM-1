After reading the chapter and watching the videos,

Using the text and the EEOC website, research some of the types of discrimination cases that are currently being filed.
  - According to the EEOC there are several types of Discrimination. There is Age, Disability, Age, Disability, Equal Pay/Compensation, Genetic Information, Harassment, National Origin, Pregnancy, Race/Color, Religion, Retaliation, Sex, and Sexual Harassment.


Next, find a recent case that interests you and summarizes it.  Summarize the case in about 250 words.  
  - Bryce Corporation, which produces flexible packaging products, hired a male senior business analyst and started to pay him 18 thousand dollar's more then there current female business analyst. After 10 months of the male new hire working there the female business analyst discovered the pay difference and requested equal pay but was denied by Bryce Corporation. Failing to pay equally for equal work violates the equal pay act and therefore was brought to the EEOC's attention in which they filed suit against Bryce Corporation. They have received a settlement offer that includes 50 thousand dollars, equal pay for all there employees, and extensive training on the issue throughout the company. Bryce was also required to make a statement that says for 2 years they will not take any action against employees because they have opposed employment practices made illegal by the EPA.
