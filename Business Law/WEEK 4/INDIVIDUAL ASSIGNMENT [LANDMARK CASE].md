Case
  - Kelo v. City of New London 545 U.S. 469

Summary
  - In 2000, the city of New London approved a development plan that was poised to have beneficial economic impact. The city purchased property and seek the eminent domain clause to acquire the remaining properties from the remaining owners. The City of New London exercised its power of eminent domain and seized private properties in purpose to an economic development plan. The city determined that the area in question was sufficiently distressed to justify eminent domain in purpose of seeking economic rejuvenation and therefore was entitled to deference. The city had carefully constructed a development plan that it believed would provide great benefits to the community, including new jobs and increased tax revenue.

  - Nine property owners contested the seizer of there land as the properties would be sold to private developers which they argued did not constitute the public use clause relating to eminent domain. The petitioners proposed that the Court adopt a new rule that economic development does not qualify as public use and is supported by neither precedent nor logic.

  - During the trial, the court prohibited the taking of some properties. Then the Connecticut Superior Court upheld all takings. Causing the owners to petition for more judicial review with the United States Supreme Court where many of there claims were rejected. The petitioners’ secondary argument that takings of this kind should require a “reasonable certainty” to ensure the public benefits will actually accrue was deemed a departure from the Court’s precedent. Stating that the Court declines to second-guess the knowledge at which this issue presides and trusts the city to do what is in there best interest.

Question
  - Does the taking of private property by the state for use by another private property for further economic development constitute "public use" under the Fifth Amendment?

Decision
  - The Court found that the development plan served a public purpose and therefore fulfilled the "public use" under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The cities plan was not adopted to benefit a particular party of individuals. Although the owners properties were not negatively effecting the area, the city's determination that a program of economic rejuvenation was justified and therefore was entitled to eminent domain. There was also no basis for exempting economic development because of the broad definition of "public purpose." In addition, while the city is not planning to open the condemned land to use by the general public, the court had "long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the public”. And instead it had chosen to embrace the broader and more common interpretation of public use as “public purpose.”

Personal Thoughts
  - I think this is a very important case for two independent reasons. One is to show the justification of eminent domain in any setting. It is important that we have a large number of cases such as this to define lines in he laws that we have. The more that we have the more we can see where the actual lines are and how cannot go against them. A eminent domain case is very important in understanding that when you live in a city the interests of the city go above your personal interests. If you really want to live a city and be proud to support it with your spending and income then you should have the best interests of it in your mind. The Second reason I find this important is that it shows how the legal system is not there to show favors to just the independent parties. Yes we have laws that protect individuals rights and property but when those rights effect the greater good then it becomes a problem of what is more important. A case like this goes to define that you keeping your property at the demise of your city can have a greater negative effect on everyone around you then just your personal rights.
