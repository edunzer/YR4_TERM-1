## INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY | JAWS

1. In the video, the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) argue about whether to close the town’s beaches.  If they keep the beaches open and a swimmer is injured or killed because they failed to warn swimmers about the potential shark danger, has Brody and the Mayor committed a tort?  If so, what kind of tort (intentional tort against persons, intentional tort against property, negligence)?  Explain your an­swer.
  - Yes, a tort is committed because they failed to warn or prevent said harm when knowing that it would take place. This would be negligence because neither party was wanting or hoping that someone would be harmed instead they just didn't warn them for there own gain in financial matters.

2. Can Chief Brody and the Mayor be held liable for any injuries or deaths to swimmers under the doctrine of strict liability?  Why or why not?
  - Yes, because they hold the responsibility of controlling the opening and closing of the beaches and since they left them open when they knew harm was possible they become liable for having a hazardous "product" in the possession that they exposed the public too.

3. Suppose that Chief Brody goes against the mayor’s instructions and warns people to stay out of the water. Nevertheless, several swimmers do not heed his warning and are injured as a result. What de­fense or defenses could Brody raise under these circumstances if he is sued for negligence?
  - Since Brody did warn people that there was a shark in the water he could be protected but the mayor however would not because he kept the beaches open which allowed people to go even though Brody "warned" them. Brody would be covered because his duties did not cover closing said beaches instead he was just in charge of safety and since he did warn them he did his job.

4.  Discuss one other tort from chapter 6 and provide an example of what this might look like in the "real world."
  - I think "foreseeability" is a very important part of the imaginary case above, because it would seal in whether or not the negligence applied to the mayor. In most negligence cases the deciding factor comes down to whether or not the accused could have foreseen that there decision would caused the result that it did. An example being: 

    > "A person assisting an inebriated individual into her car could be considered negligent due to the likelihood that harm would come to her while she is driving in an intoxicated state."
