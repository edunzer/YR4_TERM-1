## DISCUSSION | MCDONALDS HOT COFFEE

Then research the FACTS of the famous case of Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants.  Find at least two issues that each side made in their case (4 issues total).  Be sure to apply the concepts found in chapter 6 (250 words).

  Issues with the case:
    - The biggest issue in the case is that the coffee was mishandled. Putting the coffee cup in your lap is not a normal way to handle a coffee cup. Similar ideas can be put into other products where if they were misuse then you could be injured. If you bought a curly iron and then proceeded to put it in your lap while doing something else you would be burned but in no way is that the businesses fault. Every time someone puts there cup of water, soft-drink, smoothie, etc. on the dash of there car and it spills all over the place is not an issue with the business it is an issue with the consumer mishandling the product.

    - Now of course in this situation the solution of lowering the temperature of the coffee to stop people from harming themselves could be seen as reasonable. And this was the idea put forth by Ms.Lieback when suing McDonalds.

    - However there is an issue that McDonalds could present to refute this idea where there could be evidence after the fact that this change in temperature would effect the business of McDonalds. Possibly causing them losses to a business model that they have had success with for a long time.  

    - The last issue with the case that was brought up by the plaintiff which in my opinion really drove it home and grabbed the jury was the fact that McDonalds had received other complaints like this; over 700. This was seen as a basic disregard for there customers safety and wellbeing which portrayed the business as a money hungry entity and therefore won over the jury because of peoples dislike of such businesses.
