## INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT | A CIVIL ACTION

View the movie and write a critical analysis of the film. Your paper should be between 3 and 5 pages.  I'm specifically looking that you can apply the legal concepts covered in class and in the textbook to the film.  The analysis should include the following sections:

  Descriptions, in detail, of each legal issue in the movie.  Define the legal issue first.  Then describe how that is seen in the film.  Provide details.  You should be able to find at least two to three issues.
      -

  Is this movie based on a real case?  If so what was the case and the outcome?  How did it differ from the movie?

  Ethical issues in the film.  Identify at least one or more ethical issues in this film. What is the ethical issue and how could it have been handled differently  

  A “do over.” Select a principal character -  If you could change events, how would you handle things differently for the sake of the business and those affected by the events?

Your paper should reference and in-text citations the textbook and legal definitions in the textbook.  Also please include references and in-text citations for any outside research you did for the paper.  Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts that are presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic.
