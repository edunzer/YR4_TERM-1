## DISCUSSION | MORE CONTRACTS

Alaska Packers' Association Case:
  - What is at issues in this case?
    - There are two instances of going against a contract in the case. First there are the crew members who were brought to Alaska with an agreed amount of $50, then we had the second contract that was signed after this for the crew members to be payed $100. Both of these contracts were broken.

  - What do you think the outcome of this case is?
    - I think because the 2nd contract was developed after the breaking of the first it is not legally binding and therefore had no legal penalty. So then we just have the case where the workers illegally went against the first contract, and extorted the canning companies out of more money.

  - Who won and why?

Pepsico: What was the outcome and why?  (The court found three reasons.)
  -

Ball writes to Sullivan and inquires how much Sullivan is asking for a specific forty-acre tract of land Sullivan owns.  In a letter received by Ball, Sullivan states "I will not take less than $60,000 for the forty-acre tract as specified."  Ball immediately sends Sullivan a fax stating, "I accept your offer for $60,000 for the forty-acre tract as specified."  Discuss whether Ball can hold Sullivan to a contract for a sale of land.
  - This is fairly simple. Although Sullivan has stated in a "discussion" that $60,000 was the minimum price that he would accept no where did he agreed to that price with Ball. To go along with this no contracts, legal documents, or bill of sale was exchanged or signed by either party so there is no agreement in place. So, no Ball has no legal grounds to say that Sullivan can not change the price of his land.
