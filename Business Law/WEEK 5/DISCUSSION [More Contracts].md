## DISCUSSION | MORE CONTRACTS

Alaska Packers' Association Case:
  - What is at issues in this case?
    - There are two instances of going against a contract in the case. First there are the crew members who were brought to Alaska with an agreed amount of $50, then we had the second contract that was signed after this for the crew members to be payed $100. Both of these contracts were broken.

  - What do you think the outcome of this case is?
    - I think because the 2nd contract was developed after the breaking of the first it is not legally binding and therefore had no legal penalty. So then we just have the case where the workers illegally went against the first contract, and extorted the canning companies out of more money.

  - Who won and why?
    - The court decided that the second later contract was not supported by adequate consideration because the fishermen were already contractually obligated to perform the specified services and therefore the later second contract was not "official" and merely a demand for more compensation.

Pepsico: What was the outcome and why?  (The court found three reasons.)
  - This was the decision that was made:

  - "It is quite possible to make a definite and operative offer to buy or sell goods by advertisement, in a newspaper, by a handbill, a catalog or circular or on a placard in a store window.  Such advertisements are understood to be mere requests to consider and examine and negotiate; and no one can reasonably regard them as otherwise unless the circumstances are exceptional and the words used are very plain and clear. The commercial was merely an advertisement, not a unilateral offer. The commercial cannot be regarded in itself as sufficiently definite, because it specifically reserved the details of the offer to a separate writing, the Catalog."

  - Now although I do agree with the points that were made in favor of PepsiCo and how advertisements have a certain out of this word nature to them, I find it ridiculous that this was the decision made. Not only did the advertisement state how much it would cost to get there smaller products but in the same method they stated it was 7 million to get the jet. Now because those other smaller prizes were payed out they should be held accountable for the jet because it was said in the same manor. You cant say something is a defined price and change it just because its a advertisement. If that's the case then where is the line drawn for an advertisement?? Couldn't all signs in stores be considered advertisements and therefore be subject to change?

Ball writes to Sullivan and inquires how much Sullivan is asking for a specific forty-acre tract of land Sullivan owns.  In a letter received by Ball, Sullivan states "I will not take less than $60,000 for the forty-acre tract as specified."  Ball immediately sends Sullivan a fax stating, "I accept your offer for $60,000 for the forty-acre tract as specified."  Discuss whether Ball can hold Sullivan to a contract for a sale of land.
  - This is fairly simple. Although Sullivan has stated in a "discussion" that $60,000 was the minimum price that he would accept no where did he agreed to that price with Ball. To go along with this no contracts, legal documents, or bill of sale was exchanged or signed by either party so there is no agreement in place. So, no Ball has no legal grounds to say that Sullivan can not change the price of his land.
