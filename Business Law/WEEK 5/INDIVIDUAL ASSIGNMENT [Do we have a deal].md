## INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT | Do we have a deal?

This assignment will get us started.  After reading chapter 7, in a 250-word response consider the following topics (in your own words please):

What are the four requirements of a valid contract?
  - Agreement, capacity, consideration, and intention are the four elements. Agreement is farely self explanatory, but capacity is not a widely used term so here's what it is. capacity means that all parties involved in the contract must be able to understand the terms and obligations of the contract. consideration also is not widely used but it is easy to understand. Its basically a rule that parties must exchange some value for a contract to be binding. Lastly we have intention which means that all parties involved in the contract have to be clear that they intend to enter a legally binding contract and not just an agreement.

Joli signs and returns a letter from Kerin, referring to a book for sale and its price.  When Kerin delivers the book, Joli sends it back, claiming that they have no contract.  Kerin claims they do.  What standard determines whether these parties have a contract?
  - There was no agreement in place that is stated in the statement above. If the "letter" did not say anything about purchasing the book at the agreed upon price then there is no agreement. If this is not the case and Joli said in the letter that if the price is "A" then she authorizes Kerin to buy it and she, Joli, will pay here back for that book price then we have an agreement.

Dyna tells Ed that she will pay Ed $1,000 to set a fire to Dyna's store, so that she can collect funds under a fire insurance policy.  Ed sets fire to the store, but Dyna refuses to pay.  Can Ed recover? Why or Why not?
  - Considering that there was a agreement for a service provided by Ed for a payment of $1,000 from Dyna then yes there is grounds that they had an agreement; but because the "agreement" involves insurance fraud which is illegal a court or any form of law would not deem it a legal agreement. So no Ed could not get his $1,000.

Ball writes to Sullivan and inquires how much Sullivan is asking for a specific forty-acre tract of land Sullivan owns.  In a letter received by Ball, Sullivan states "I will not take less than $60,000 for the forty-acre tract as specified."  Ball immediately sends Sullivan a fax stating, "I accept your offer for $60,000 for the forty-acre tract as specified."  Discuss whether Ball can hold Sullivan to a contract for a sale of land.
  - This is fairly simple. Although Sullivan has stated in a "discussion" that $60,000 was the minimum price that he would accept no where did he agreed to that price with Ball. To go along with this no contracts, legal documents, or bill of sale was exchanged or signed by either party so there is no agreement in place. So, no Ball has no legal grounds to say that Sullivan can not change the price of his land.

Lastly, watch the following video clip about a contract between Charley Brown and Lucy.  Analyze the clip.  do they have a contract or not?  Why or why not?
  - Yes there are some grounds that Lucy went against her word, but as stated in the video it wasn't an official document. Also there was no agreement stated in that document by both parties so really its just an "offer" by Lucy that was not officially accepted buy Charley Brown.
