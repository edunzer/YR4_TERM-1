## INTRODUCTION

Hi everyone. My name is Ethan I am a junior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. This means that I will be going into the tech field; more specifically Web marketing, email marketing, and Web development. As far as information about me, I grew up in Lake Oswego (Portland) and moved to Bend 3 years ago but am hoping to move back as soon as possible. You can probably guess that I like computers but I also like working on my car and cooking.
