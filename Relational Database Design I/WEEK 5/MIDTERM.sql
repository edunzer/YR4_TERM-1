USING AP Database

Write a SELECT statement that returns two columns based on the Vendors table. The first column, Contact, is the vendor contact name in this format: first name followed by last initial (for example, "John S") The second column, Phone, is the VendorPhone column without the area code. Only return rows for those vendors in the 559 area code. Sort the result set by first name, then last name.
